                I’m driven by the intersection of robotics, automation, and Industry 4.0—building manufacturing systems that are practical, scalable, and ready for real-world use. I enjoy being close to the production floor, where designs are assembled, tested, and refined, not just imagined. I thrive in collaborative environments focused on improving reliability and turning emerging technologies into solutions that work at industrial scale.

                <h4>Manufacturing Engineer <span class="company"> | The Boeing Company, Bangalore, India</span></h4>
                <p class="dates">Aug 2023 – Apr 2025</p>
                <div class="work-summary">
                    Spearheaded the optimization of manufacturing sequences for 777-9 aircraft wiring systems, focusing on the elimination of bottlenecks within the production lifecycle. By integrating Lean principles and rigorous SQCDP (Safety, Quality, Cost, Delivery, and People) analysis, I executed process improvements that realized a 15% reduction in cycle time and a 20% decrease in wiring rework. Beyond immediate production gains, I developed comprehensive standardized work instructions to ensure consistent assembly quality and operational excellence across global manufacturing sites.

                <div class="work-summary">
                    Overhauled and inspected offshore hydraulic skidding systems by implementing structured validation and maintenance procedures to ensure long-term mechanical reliability. Through rigorous root-cause analysis of pump and motor failures—leveraging real-time flow and pressure data—I executed system optimizations that successfully increased equipment uptime by 10%. Additionally, I supported the testing and commissioning of modular hydraulic manifolds, where I designed and implemented fixture improvements that significantly stabilized the testing environment, reduced leakage rates, and minimized rework.

                    Advanced the electromechanical design and manufacturability of circuit breakers and switch gears through iterative modeling in Creo and structural validation in ANSYS to support Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and cost reduction initiatives. By optimizing critical tolerances and component interfaces, I successfully bridged the gap between initial design and high-volume production. These refinements directly resulted in a 10% reduction in tooling complexity and assembly time, demonstrating a measurable improvement in production efficiency while maintaining strict adherence to electromechanical performance standards.
